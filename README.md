Summary: 

UTAH Accident Analysis : <br>
In pursuit of providing a type of data analysis that will shed light on the elements that are central in determining the causes, and influential in predicting the number of vehicle accidents in Utah, our group will focus on multiple factors in our data set. In our analysis, we will take location, weather, time, alcohol and age into consideration and will choose the best element to focus. By the end of our analysis, these factors and their relationship with one another should be able to approximately predict how the future of motor vehicle collision are being shaped with respect to the rapid growth of populations in Utah. We hope, we can answer questions such as: 
1. How much and how fast are accidents going to rise in Utah? 
2. How will the changes in weather influence the accidents rate? 
3. How will the geographical distribution of accidents in State of Utah will look like in the future? 
4. What will be our expected age range in most of the vehicle collisions in Utah? 

House Price Prediction (kaggle): <br> 
1. This was a Kaggle competition project to predict home values in Ames, IA. There is both a training dataset (1460 observations) and a test dataset(1459 observations) and the outcome variable is SalePrice which is omitted from the test data set. Having 79 explanatory variables like LotArea, Neighborhood, Overallqual the data set describes almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, and the challenge in this competition was to predict the final price of houses based on these predictors and how they influence the final price. The goal was to create a model that works well with test data whose performance will be judged by Root mean square error, R square and the score that got generated after uploading the file to Kaggle.
2. Our out of sample performance was an RMSE of .1255 and an R-squared of .9017. The in-sample performance was an RMSE of .1203 and a R-squared of .9095. Overall we achieved a RMSE of .1259 and an R-squared of .9011 on our test data set. With our submission to the Kaggle competition, we received a rank of 1673.

GitHub Data Analysis:<br> 
1. The objective was to try to predict the number of Stars based on Forks, Contributors, Issues, and Readme Length.
2. The Github website was scraped and custom dataset was prepared for analysis.
